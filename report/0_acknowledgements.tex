\begin{abstract}
I would like to sincerely thank Linard Arquint who supervised me throughout this thesis.
He made himself available every week, whether in his office in Zurich or from the USA, to discuss for several hours the many questions I had.
Without him, this project would not have progressed as far as it has. 
I would also like to thank him for his very attentive proofreading of this thesis, and for the hundreds of comments that helped improve it. 

I would also like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Peter MÃ¼ller and all the members of the Programming Methodology Group at ETH Zurich, for giving me the opportunity to complete this thesis with them, and for the questions and feedback they gave me during my oral presentations.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support throughout my studies, especially during this thesis.
